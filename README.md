# Online Discussion Quality Literature Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of literature related to the evaluation and facilitation of online discussions, with a focus on the role of Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset includes references to key literature drawn from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Social Sciences.

## Background

This collection supports the research presented in our survey titled **Evaluation and Facilitation of Online Discussions in the LLM Era: A Survey**. Our study explores how online conversations, while intended to foster mutual understanding, often degrade into harmful exchanges. We investigate the potential for LLMs to act as facilitation agents that moderate and enhance the quality of online interactions.
