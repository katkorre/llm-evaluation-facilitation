Online Discussion Quality Literature Repository

Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of literature related to the assessment and enhancement of online discussion quality, with a focus on the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in improving discourse. The dataset includes references to key research papers, methods, and frameworks drawn from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Social Sciences.

Background

This collection supports the research presented in our survey titled "Assessing and Enhancing the Quality of Online Discussions with Large Language Models". Our study explores how online conversations, while intended to foster mutual understanding, often degrade into harmful exchanges. We investigate the potential for LLMs to act as facilitation agents that moderate and enhance the quality of online interactions.

Key Themes Covered

Taxonomy of Discussion Quality: Frameworks and metrics for evaluating online discourse.

Intervention and Facilitation Strategies: Methods to guide conversations toward constructive engagement.

Facilitation Datasets: A taxonomy of datasets designed for conversation improvement and moderation.

LLM Best Practices and Future Directions: Insights into leveraging LLMs for healthier online communication spaces.
